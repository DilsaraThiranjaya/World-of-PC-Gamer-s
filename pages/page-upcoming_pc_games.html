                        Based on the classic 16th-century novel Journey to the West, Black Myth Wukong is rooted in
                        Chinese history and mythology. This RPG game will see you take on the role of the Destined One
                        to explore expansive environments, solve puzzles, enter into combat, and encounter all manner of
                        enemies huge and small. The game also introduces spells and magic, where you’re expected to know
                        when to use these to your advantage and when to preserve them. Your weapon of choice is a staff,
                        which we’re sure comes with all manner of techniques and attack styles – but which will you
                        choose to master?

                        First revealed during Blizzcon 2023, World of Warcraft: The War Within takes us into the
                        subterranean world that lies below the land of Azeroth itself, where Xal’atath, The Harbinger of
                        the Void, lies in wait. It’s also the long-forgotten seat of the Nerubian Empire – if you’ve got
                        arachnophobia, be sure to turn back now. However, we won’t be consigned to the depths forever.
                        We can also expect to explore the Isle of Dorn, the Earthern capital located just off the
                        western shore of Pandaria. The Earthen also serves as The War Within’s new playable Allied race,
                        available after completing their dedicated questline.
                      </p>
                      <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        Naturally, a variety of new dungeons and raids are due to arrive with the expansion, though
                        Blizzard is also expanding the MMORPG’s endgame with the introduction of Delves. This latest
                        system consists of 13 self-contained adventures to retrieve rare treasure from underground
                        vaults as part of the Dragonscale Expedition and can be completed either solo or as part of a
                        group. New WoW talents, quests, and epic loot await, and that’s just scratching the surface – we
                        haven’t even mentioned what’s going on with Anduin and Thrall.

                        Nearly two decades since the release of S.T.A.L.K.E.R, the horror sequel is finally on its way.
                        Judging by all the gameplay from Summer Game Fest and the official site’s proud discussion of
                        its use of mo-cap and photogrammetry tech, it looks like Stalker 2 should be worth the wait.
                        Take a look at our Stalker 2 release date guide for more details.
